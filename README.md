## About the Video Course
In this third volume, now that you are an expert in Jenkins and the Jenkins pipeline, you will improve the quality in your delivery process by implementing an acceptance stage in workflows; we will discuss the test types and add automated API and UI tests to the pipeline. Moving forward, you will understand how to automate the execution of database scripts and add a new stage to your pipeline to manage database migrations.
Going beyond this, you will learn about branching strategies and how to implement continuous feedback on every feature branch using Jenkins multi-branch. Moving on, you'll improve the quality of your software development workflows and learn how to integrate Jenkins with GitHub to automatically build pull requests.
